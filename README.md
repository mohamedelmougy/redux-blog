# React Ecosystem Overview & Best Practices

The React ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving, providing developers with a wide range of tools and libraries to create efficient and scalable web applications. This document outlines some key components of the React ecosystem, including React.js, Redux Toolkit, React Router DOM, React Hook Form, and best practices for development.
## 1. Tech Stack

- Framework: `React.js`
- State Management: `Redux Toolkit`
- Styling: `Pure CSS`
- Form: `React Hook Form`
- Router: `React Router DOM`
- Linting: `ESLint`
- Backend: `json server`



## 2. Best Practices

To build efficient and maintainable React applications, consider the following best practices:

### Component Design
- **Keep Components Small:** Aim for single responsibility components to enhance reusability and testing.
- **Use Functional Components:** Prefer functional components with hooks for new codebases.

### Separation of Concerns
- **Separate Logic and UI:** Keep business logic separate from UI components. Use custom hooks or Redux for state management and side effects, allowing components to focus solely on rendering UI.
- **File Structure:** Organize your project by separating components, styles, and tests. This helps in maintaining clarity and navigability as the project scales.
- **Use Presentational and Container Components:** Adopt the separation of presentational (UI-focused) and container (logic-focused) components, making it easier to manage and test your code.

### Form Handling
- **Utilize React Hook Form:** Use React Hook Form for efficient form management and validation.

### Routing
- **Organize Routes:** Structure your routes logically, keeping nested routes clear and manageable.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

```bash
